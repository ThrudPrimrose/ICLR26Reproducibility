# lang-cpp

Score = MULTI-CORE speedup vs a SERIAL same-toolchain build. Threading: the openmp-cpp page, or a
parallel algorithm below -- one spelling per loop.

## Harness facts

- Flags (fixed, also shown in the main prompt): `g++ -std=c++23 -O3 -march=native -fopenmp` plus
  the strict-FP set. `-ffast-math` is never on -- reassociation is yours to authorize per loop and
  must stay inside tolerance. LLVM 22 (`clang++`) via the submission's `compiler` field.
- `<execution>` asks nothing of you: the judge finds oneTBB and appends `-ltbb` to every C++ link.
  Declare no library.
- The signature is fixed and already spells `__restrict__`; keep every qualifier. `workspace` may
  be NULL and `workspace_size` 0 unless you asked via `workspace_bytes` -- check both. It is the
  only 256B-aligned buffer.

## The expensive mistakes

1. **Dropping the stub's include block.** The file opens with `<cstdint> ... <execution> <omp.h>`
   and the signature is spelled in `std::int64_t`. Pasting back only the function loses the
   headers and dies on the signature -- the LARGEST build failure on record (71 of 81 across two
   C++ arms). **Edit in place. Never replace the whole file.**
2. **Claiming alignment on an ABI pointer.** `assume_aligned` or an OpenMP `aligned(p:...)` clause
   on a judge input pointer SIGSEGVs at vector width. Inputs carry NATURAL alignment only; the
   workspace and storage you allocate yourself are fair game.
3. **Rewriting a loop must not change WHICH elements it writes.** A hand-unrolled
   `i < n - 3; i += 4` body stops at the last whole group on purpose; rerolling to `i < n` writes
   elements the reference does not. Sizes are fuzzed, so `n % 4 != 0` is the normal case.

## Parallel algorithms (`<execution>`)

`par` / `par_unseq` are genuinely parallel here -- same standing as an OpenMP directive, and the
same independence PROMISE: a recurrence or colliding indexed write under a policy races and
returns wrong answers with no diagnostic. Classify the loop first (openmp-cpp bins).

- Say what the loop means: `transform`, `reduce`, `transform_reduce`, `inclusive_scan` /
  `exclusive_scan` (the parallel spelling of a running sum), `for_each` over an index view.
  `accumulate` / `partial_sum` are ordered by definition and take no policy.
- `par_unseq` over `par` where the body allows it. `reduce`/`transform_reduce` reassociate FP --
  that is what makes them parallel; `score` is the check.
- The element callable must be self-contained: no allocation, no locks, no shared mutable capture,
  no throwing.
- Contiguous random-access iterators only -- raw pointers or `std::span`. One policy call per
  loop, hoisted out of any enclosing loop.

```cpp
double s = std::transform_reduce(std::execution::par_unseq, w, w + n, v, 0.0, std::plus<>{},
                                 std::multiplies<>{});
```

## Writing fast C++

- **Row-major**: the innermost loop walks the LAST index, unit stride.
- **`__restrict__` on every non-aliasing pointer**; helpers and local copies lose it unless
  re-spelled. Inner loop over a raw pointer or `std::span`, bound once outside.
- **Scalars over length-1 arrays**: accumulate in a scalar local, store once.
- **One index type everywhere**: `int64_t`, matching the ABI symbols.
- **No hidden calls in hot loops**: `virtual`, `std::function`, out-of-TU helpers. Keep helpers
  `static` and in-file.
- Plain countable loops: bound known at entry, one exit, induction variable not mutated.

## Workflow

- Compile locally with the judge's own build line (main prompt) and READ the errors and warnings;
  iterate until clean before spending a judge call. `syntax_check` is the free in-turn variant.
- Iterate with `score`; `submit` every correct improvement.
- Profiling is its own tool (`profile`, see its page): reach for it when a correct version stops
  improving, not before.
- Your context is finite: do NOT re-read the file after an edit that reported success.
